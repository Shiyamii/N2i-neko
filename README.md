## Overview

**CleanTheOcean** is a fun and educational web application developed in **Angular** during the **Nuit de l'Info** by the MIAGE team "**Neko x Ficsit Corporations**".

The project aims to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our oceans by simulating a game where players must clean up waste from the sea. However, the challenge intensifies as the waste continues to increase over time, requiring quick actions to keep the ocean clean!

By playing, users learn about the urgency of keeping our seas healthy, as they are vital to sustaining life on Earth. üåç

## Code Snippets

### Main Game Logic
Here‚Äôs an example of the Angular component driving the game:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-beach',
  templateUrl: './beach.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./beach.component.scss'],
})
export class BeachComponent {
  images: { src: string; position: [number, number] }[] = [];
  imageCount = 0;
  maxImages = 100;
  score = 0;
  private intervalId: any;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.updateImagePosition();
  }

  randomScreenCoordinates(): [number, number] {
    const width = window.innerWidth;
    const height = window.innerHeight;
    return [
      Math.floor(Math.random() * width),
      Math.floor(Math.random() * height),
    ];
  }

  addImage() {
    if (this.imageCount < this.maxImages) {
      const newImage = {
        src: './assets/images/Picture' + (Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1) + '.png',
        position: this.randomScreenCoordinates(),
      };
      this.images.push(newImage);
      this.imageCount++;
    }
  }

  updateImagePosition() {
    this.intervalId = setInterval(() => this.addImage(), 500);
  }

  imgClick(event: { src: string; position: [number, number] }) {
    this.images = this.images.filter((img) => img !== event);
    this.imageCount--;
    this.score++;
  }
}
```
